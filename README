=============================== WARNING ===============================

This addon doesn't actually fight the fish, it waits the provided catch
delay time and then injects a packet that tells the server the fish has
zero HP and you're pulling it up. When you start fishing, you need to
use the exact spelling and capitalization (quoted when spaces are
needed) the game uses for the bait and fish. If the bite ID for the fish
is unknown it will catch every unknown fish/item/monster using a very
long catch delay until it finds the correct bite ID. You can also cancel
a fish on the line normally at any time.

Fisher will automatically stop running under the following conditions:
    You reach the 200 fish catch limit for the day.
    You run out of bait.
    You run out of inventory space.
    An action is performed on you by a monster or another player.
    Your status changes.
    You receive a message from a GM.
    You perform an action.
    You change zones.

To install this addon, create a folder called "fisher" inside the
Windower addons folder and copy the fisher.lua file there. Your addon
folder is most likely "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windower4\addons".
