This script is a fishing addon to be used with Windower for Final
Fantasy XI.

You can report issues, get the latest version, and view the source at:

To install this addon, create a folder called "fisher" inside the Windower
addons folder (most likely C:\Program Files (x86)\Windower4\addons) and copy
the fisher.lua file there.

This is a very rough example of how to implement a fishing bot with the
Windower Lua API. It's hardcoded to catch Hakuryu and has no ability to equip
more bait, move fish/bait around or anything else fancy like that.

THIS IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
