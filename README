To install this addon, create a folder called "fisher" inside the Windower
addons folder (most likely C:\Program Files (x86)\Windower4\addons) and copy
the fisher.lua file there.

To run this addon, in the Final Fantasy XI input line type:
//lua load fisher

After the addon is loaded you can display usage info by typing:
//fisher

The fish that will be caught and the bait that will be used are hardcoded
for now. Set the chat level to 3 to see fish info packets to find the fish
bite id for the fish you want to catch.
